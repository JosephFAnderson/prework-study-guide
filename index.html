          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming language used by devolopers to define how webpager content is presented to users</li>
          <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization</li>
          <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is where you style an element directly in the HTML File</li>
          <li>Inline CSS applies to a particular page element. Thus they are quick but less flexible</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet is where you embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element</li>
          <li>The internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage that apply to the page. Thus allow you to style multiple elements at once</li>
          <li>External style sheet are a seperate file that are referenced with a link element palced in the HTML's head element</li>
          <li>External style sheets are the most common method as it allows devolopers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file (Seperation of concerns)</li>
          <li>Seperation of concerns refers to separating code into different files based on use. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns>Wiki article</a></li>
